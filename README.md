# f1-fantasy-optimisation
Optimises an F1 Fantasy League team using MATLAB.  For the fantasy league details, see: http://fantasy.udt.co.za/f1/

The program:
1) Uses bookies odds to estimate the outcome of the race.
2) Calculates the number of points each driver and constructor will receive according to the rules of the fantasy league game (http://fantasy.udt.co.za/f1/).
3) Calculates the points that every possible combination of driver and constructor that is valid under the game rules (eg. within cost) will receive.
4) Informs you of the optimum substitutions you can make to your team
